# Security Policy

## **1. Protection, Detection, and Response**

The **DimLight** Security Response Center is part of the defender community and remains at the forefront of security response development. We work closely with security researchers to protect our customers and the broader ecosystem from threats.

## **2. Reporting Vulnerabilities**

**DimLight** follows the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process. We encourage you to follow these guidelines to help us protect customers and the ecosystem from potential harm.

You can contact us via the [**admin email**](mailto:email@dimlight.top), or directly report vulnerabilities to the developers of the following open-source software:

- [**Debian 12**](https://www.debian.org/security/)
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/)
- [**Nginx**](https://nginx.org/en/security_advisories.html)
- [**Emby**](https://emby.media/)
- [**Jellyseerr**](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr)
- [**EmbyBoss**](https://github.com/berry8838/Sakura_embyboss)
- [**MariaDB**](https://mariadb.org/)
- [**Rclone**](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/security)
- [**MoviePilot**](https://github.com/jxxghp/MoviePilot)

## **3. Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Method**

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, researchers should disclose vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or services directly to the affected product vendors. The typical CVD process is as follows:

1. Researchers privately report the vulnerability to the vendor first.
2. National CERTs or other coordinators may also report the vulnerability privately.
3. With the researcher's consent, the vendor will fix the vulnerability and provide a fully tested update or solution.

Researchers maintain close cooperation with vendors throughout the investigation to ensure the vulnerability is addressed promptly. After the update is released, the vendor reports progress to the researcher and, when appropriate, discloses the vulnerability publicly.

If the vulnerability is being actively exploited and the vendor has not yet patched it, researchers and vendors will work as closely as possible to disclose the vulnerability publicly to protect customers.
